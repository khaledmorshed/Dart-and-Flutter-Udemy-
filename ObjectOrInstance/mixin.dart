//Mixins are defined in the Dart documentation as "a way of reusing a classâ€™s
//code in multiple class hierarchies". Simply said, mixins allow you to plug in
//blocks of code without needing to create subclasses.

//Mixins are a very useful way of avoiding code duplication without inheritance.
// The fact that mixins can be also limited to work only with a particular class
// makes them powerful allies in the development of your apps.

//mixin is used for avoiding extra class or duplicate methods
